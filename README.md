  ## Description

  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

  For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

  ## Installation
  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  TO create React install -npx create-react-app 
  npm install

  ## Usage
     
  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
